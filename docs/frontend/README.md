# Albunyaan Tube Admin Frontend

This Vite + Vue 3 application implements the Phase 3 admin shell for Albunyaan Tube.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in an `.env` file (see `.env.example`) so the UI can reach the backend authentication endpoints.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` – type-check with `vue-tsc` and build the production bundle.
- `npm run preview` – preview the built assets locally.

## Next Steps

Upcoming milestones will replace the placeholder registry, moderation, users, and audit views with fully functional data tables wired to the backend APIs.
