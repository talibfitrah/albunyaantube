# Mockup Asset Location

The Albunyaan Tube product mockups are maintained in the shared Figma project **"Albunyaan Tube UX"** within the design team's workspace. Designers export the latest PNG sequences (e.g., `1_splash_screen.png`â€“`10_player_screen.png`) from the `Android` page of that file when needed for handoff or documentation. Engineering and product stakeholders can request viewer access through the design lead to download the assets.

To keep the repository lightweight, rendered PNGs are not committed here. When snapshots are required for offline reference, place them in this directory under a dated subfolder (for example, `2024-04-android/`).
