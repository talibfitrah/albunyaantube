# Moderator Walkthrough — Search & Import UX

## Goal
Validate that the tri-state Include/Exclude workflow and bulk moderation tooling meet moderator expectations before development begins.

## Session Outline (30–40 min)
1. **Context (5 min)** — Product owner presents goals: halal catalog curation, no algorithmic drift.
2. **Live Figma Demo (10 min)** — Walk through blended search results, channel/playlist drawers, bulk bar behavior.
3. **Hands-on Scenario Review (15 min)**
   - Approving a new channel with selective exclusions.
   - Excluding a playlist video batch.
   - Reversing an accidental exclusion.
4. **Feedback & Risks (10 min)** — Capture usability concerns, accessibility needs, localization issues.
5. **Next Steps (5 min)** — Confirm follow-up actions, additional mockups, or policy clarifications.

## Materials
- Figma prototype: _link pending_

- Acceptance criteria: [`docs/acceptance/criteria.md`](../acceptance/criteria.md#admin-console-criteria)

## Participants
- Moderation team reps (minimum 2 time zones)

## Key Questions to Validate
- Is the tri-state toggle wording clear in English, Arabic, Dutch?
- Does the bulk bar provide enough context (counts, warnings)?
- Are keyboard shortcuts or batch selection patterns necessary?
- Do moderators need saved searches or filters beyond current scope?

## Follow-Up Checklist
- [ ] Update UX spec if layout tweaks required.
- [ ] Adjust acceptance criteria/testing plan based on feedback.
- [ ] Incorporate localization notes into translation brief.
- [ ] Revisit moderation training materials with updated flow.
