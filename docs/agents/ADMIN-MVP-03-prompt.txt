Your assignment
- Ticket ID: ADMIN-MVP-03
- Title: Registry category filter
- Phase: 3
- Goal: Finalize shared registry filter component + store per roadmap gaps
- Status/Owner/Depends/LastReviewed: partial/TBD-frontend/—/2025-09-30
- AC IDs: —
- Tests to touch/add: —

Constraints
- Do not alter layouts/spacing/copy unless the ticket allows it.
- Respect dark/light token system and canonical tab icons.

Pre-flight reasoning (must do before coding)
1) Locate the ticket meta and confirm status/depends/owner.
2) Verify backlog row fields and AC/test mapping. Ensure not DONE and no owner conflict.
3) Validate dependencies are DONE or non-blocking; otherwise propose a smaller slice or exit.
4) Conflict scan: list files you expect to modify; check recent changes to avoid overlap.
5) Map changes to AC IDs and named tests; define success criteria (code paths, tests, docs updates).

Execution plan
- Provide ≤8 file-scoped steps; include docs + traceability updates at end.

Guardrails
- Keep changes surgical and token/tab-aware; add/update tests near changed code.
- Enforce 300s timeout for `npm test` (see AGENTS.md).

Deliverables
- Code diff with paths, updated tests that pass, backlog/traceability/docs updates, and a final summary mapping diff → ticket → AC IDs → tests.

Start
1) Print your pre-flight reasoning with file:line citations to roadmap/backlog.
2) Print your execution plan.
3) Await confirmation or continue if explicitly allowed.
