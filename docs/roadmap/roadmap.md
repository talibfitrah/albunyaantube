## How To Use This Roadmap (multi-agent)
- Each phase below begins with “Execution Metadata” listing Status, Last Reviewed, Dependencies, and Owners (TBD where unassigned).
- When work lands, append a short “Delivered in this repo” snippet under the relevant phase with file paths and any follow‑ups required.
- Keep `docs/backlog/product-backlog.csv` in sync (append rows for newly discovered work; mark status inline in Description until a formal “Status” column is introduced).

This roadmap expresses Albunyaan Tube's design-first delivery strategy. Every phase lists an estimate plus the activities required to exit the phase using the cadence `Estimate → Goals → Proposed Diff → Tests → Implement → Reflect`. Linked artifacts live in this repository so future engineering teams inherit a complete, traceable blueprint.

## Phase 0 — Discovery & Contracts
**Estimate**: 2 calendar weeks cross-discipline (Product, Architecture, UX, Security).

**Goals**
- Capture the product vision, success metrics, and constraints in `docs/vision/vision.md`.

- Establish traceability between requirements, future APIs, and acceptance criteria.

**Proposed Diff**
- `README.md`: orient contributors on how to consume the design artifacts.
- `docs/api/openapi-draft.yaml`: end-to-end endpoint coverage per brief.
- `docs/architecture/solution-architecture.md` + `docs/architecture/diagrams/*.md`: C4 + key sequences.
